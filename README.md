About the API
----------------
It is designed for GET Requests only given that the data presented here is pulled directly for [Denver's RTD developer site](http://www.rtd-denver.com/Developer.shtml). Our intention is to provide this data in an easy to utilize manner from a development perspective. Currently the api is presented in JSON format. We are planning on having a PostgreSql API available in the future with more routing and variability.

How to setup:

* Coming Soon
